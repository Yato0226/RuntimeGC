# RuntimeGC 1.5
Warning Please backup your save before using this.</b>

I just tried to update this, and I also don't have particularly good knowledge about modding.
Overall, it's working like old times, but I don't know if there's an incompatibility with other mods.
If the owner wants to remove this, I will remove it.
